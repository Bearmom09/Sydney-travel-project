        <h3>Why Sydney?</h3>
        <h2>Sydney Opera House</h2>
        <p>
            The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon and completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973, 16 years after Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition
        </p>
        <p>
            The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
        </p>
        <p>
            The building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, with many resident companies such as Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year

            <h4>The Grounds of Alexandria</h4>
            <p>The Grounds of Alexandria, the original location established in 2012, is one of Sydney’s favourite hospitality destinations. It boasts the famous Grounds Cafe, the restaurant The Potting Shed, the iconic Garden Bar & BBQ, and fabulous themed installations which draw people from all over Sydney and the world. The Grounds of Alexandria is also home to an array of unique private event spaces, hosting everything from intimate gatherings to weddings and corporate events.</p>
        <h5>Adress: </h5>
        <p>7a/2 Huntley Street, Alexandria NSW 2015</p>
        <h5>What I like about it</h5>
        <p>You will have to combat Disneyland-like wait times, prams larger than a Smart car and squadrons of Instagrammers for a spot at this Alexandria theme park of a café, but there's nothing else quite like it.</p>

            <h4>Piña Potts Point</h4>
            <p>Located opposite Room Ten in Llankelly Place, Pina is, in theory, an extra space to cater for Room Ten’s overflow. But in reality, it’s a beast all its own – with a much larger kitchen and three distinct dining areas, all centred around the open kitchen. Pull up a seat in the intimate indoor dining room with pendant lighting; a bar that look out over the laneway; or covered seating in the alleyway.

As with Room Ten, which counts celebrity chefs such as Neil Perry and “Big” Sam Young among its legion of fans, Pina is all about everyday dishes locals can rely on. But there are a few flourishes.</p>
        <h5>Adress: </h5>
        <p>4/29 Orwell St, Potts Point NSW 2011, Australia</p>
        <h5>What I like about it</h5>
        <p>The general rule of thumb on Piña’s all-day menu is that it serves breakfast and lunch classics with a touch of class. So, instead of scrambled eggs, you get super fluffy, chilli oil-infused scrambled eggs on an extra thick slab of toast. Piña’s side game is strong, and mixing and matching sides is all part of the fun.</p>

            <h4>Lunas</h4>
            <p>“A Portuguese oasis in Petersham,” is what Jose Silva and wife Basia wanted to create with their corner-eatery Lunas, named after the couple’s daughter. And we’d say they’ve pretty much nailed it. The all-day café serves classic breakfasts with Portuguese flavours – think hotcakes with a Portuguese tart custard, cinnamon, raspberries and vanilla ice cream; and chorizo scrambled eggs with onion, sobrasada (cured sausage), chives, coriander, and gordal olives. Take a seat in the courtyard which overlooks the verdant garden, lush with herbs, citrus, fig and pomegranate trees.</p>
        <h5>Adress: </h5>
        <p>316 Stanmore Road Petersham, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2049</p>
        <h5>What I like about it</h5>
        <p>Delicious menu, great coffee & delightful service.
